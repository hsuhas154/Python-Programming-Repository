    "In Python, when you open a file, you can specify the mode in which you want to interact with the file. The file modes dictate whether you can read, write, or append to the file. Here are the most commonly used file modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reading Modes:\n",
    "   - `\"r\"`: Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist or an error occurs while opening, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`. You can read the file's contents but cannot write or modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `\"rb\"`: Read in binary mode. Opens the file for binary reading. It's used when working with binary files like images, audio, or non-text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Writing Modes:\n",
    "   - `\"w\"`: Write mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, it will be truncated (its content will be deleted). If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `\"wb\"`: Write in binary mode. Opens the file for binary writing. Used when working with binary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `\"x\"`: Exclusive creation. Opens the file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation will fail. This mode is used to ensure you don't accidentally overwrite an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Appending Modes:\n",
    "   - `\"a\"`: Append mode. Opens the file for writing, but data is added to the end of the file without overwriting existing content. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `\"ab\"`: Append in binary mode. Opens the file for binary appending.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reading and Writing Modes:\n",
    "   - `\"r+\"`: Read and write mode. Opens the file for both reading and writing. If the file does not exist, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `\"rb+\"`: Read and write in binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `\"w+\"`: Write and read mode. Opens the file for both reading and writing. If the file already exists, it will be truncated; if not, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `\"wb+\"`: Write and read in binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `\"a+\"`: Append and read mode. Opens the file for both reading and writing, with data added to the end of the file without overwriting existing content. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `\"ab+\"`: Append and read in binary mode.\n",
